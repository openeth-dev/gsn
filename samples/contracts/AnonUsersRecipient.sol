 * A contract that accepts anonymous calls.
 * Anonymous calls should generally be avoided, since the contract may be
 * abused by attackers. E.g. a relay sending bogus high-fee transactions.
 * There are several ways to mitigate such abuse:
 * - accept anonymous calls for specific target methods and only from known relays.
 * - require the caller to perform some operation prior the call, so it is no longer anonymous.
 *   E.g. fill a captcha in a website and get a token which can be tested by accept_relayed_call.
