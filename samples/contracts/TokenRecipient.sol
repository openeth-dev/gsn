 * Sample Token-based relay recipient.
 * This is a base contract for a Contract accepting incoming calls to be paid by tokens.
 * The caller doesn't have to hold any ether, but should have tokens.
 * Before each call, the caller is charged the given amount of tokens.
 * Note that this payment is valid even if the contract rejects the call.
 *
 * The relay will be unaware of this arrangement, and will get its fee in ether, as usual.
 * (the sample below is very simplistic: the amount of tokens per call is fixed, and doesn't reflect
 *  any price fluctuations or actual transaction gas cost)
