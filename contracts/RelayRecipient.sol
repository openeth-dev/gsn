// Contract that implements the relay recipient protocol.  Inherited by Gatekeeper, or any other relay recipient.
//
// The recipient contract is responsible to:
// * pass a trusted IRelayHub singleton to the constructor.
// * Implement acceptRelayedCall, which acts as a whitelist/blacklist of senders.  It is advised that the recipient's owner will be able to update that list to remove abusers.
// * In every function that cares about the sender, use "address sender = getSender()" instead of msg.sender.  It'll return msg.sender for non-relayed transactions, or the real sender in case of relayed transactions.
